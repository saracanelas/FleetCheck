# FleetCheck – Build Systems Lab

This project is intentionally incomplete. Follow the worksheet in the order given.

Expected final application output:

```
FleetCheck 1.0
Vehicles loaded: 4
Vehicles requiring service: 2
Average mileage: 37000 km
```

Do not copy the solution POM. The objective is to observe how each build change alters the result.

[ERROR] /C:/Users/sarai/Downloads/FleetCheck_Starter/FleetCheck_Starter/src/main/java/pt/upt/fleetcheck/App.java:[3,39] package com.fasterxml.jackson.core.type does not exist

this error is caused by this import in App
import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.type.TypeReference;

This failure is better, because it means the code is correct and can be compiled, and now its logic can be successfully tested and altered to pass the logic tests.
